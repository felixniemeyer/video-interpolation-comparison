# ComfyUI Video Frame Interpolation Comparison

I have created these scripts to turn frames into videos, lable them and arrange them in a grid for comparison. 
Also includes a ComfyUI workflow to apply all Fannovel16 video interpolations to a webp video. 

# directory structure
The scripts expect frames to be in `./<name>/<VFI model>*.png`.
Execute make-comparison-video.sh from `./` with `name` as argument to create a comparison video.
